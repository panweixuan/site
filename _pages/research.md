As the fundamental building blocks of the large-scale structure of the Universe, dark matter halos are typically located on filaments or at their junctions, though some reside in lower-density voids. The galaxies we observe often form within these halos. Consequently, studying dark halos can deepen our understanding of galaxy evolution, while the study of galaxies, in turn, can constrain halo properties and thus inform dark matter models. In this study, I focus on several commonly discussed properties of dark halos, such as density profile, mass function, among others.

## M81 Dust Attenuation Modeling and Fitting
### Advisor: [Yewei Mao](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1681/18121.htm)
### 05/2025 - 7/2025

Dust grains absorb ultraviolet and visible photons, creating a characteristic "UV bump" feature around 2175√Ö linked to organic particles like PAHs. Without correcting for dust effects, stellar formation rates and masses can be significantly misestimated, making it crucial to understand galactic attenuation properties.

I investigated the attenuation properties of spiral galaxy M81. Theoretical modeling showed systematic dimming, reddening, and UV depression with increasing optical depth in stellar spectra. I constructed a 17-band SED from ultraviolet to mid-infrared and fitted it using a two-component power-law intrinsic model combined with various extinction curves. The Milky Way extinction law performed best with a reduced œá¬≤ ‚âà 7.3, suggesting M81's dust properties resemble those of our Galaxy.

I presented a flash talk in our department to report my research findings. [Click here](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fpanweixuan%2Fsite%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2Ffiles%2FWeixuan_M81AttCurv.pptx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) to view my slide.

## Spectroscopy of one H II region in the external galaxy NGC 0925
### Advisor: [Yewei Mao](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1681/18121.htm)
### 05/2024 - 11/2024

H II regions are where star formation takes place in the galaxy, characterized by a series of emission lines in their spectra. Spectral observation and analysis are the primary methods used to study the properties of H II regions. Using the 2.16-meter telescope at [the Xinglong Observatory of the National Astronomical Observatories](http://www.xinglong-naoc.cn/html/en/), we carried out spectral observations and analysis of an H II region in the galaxy NGC 0925. Based on the obtained emission line spectrum, the Balmer Decrement method was applied to determine the intrinsic extinction of the region (AÔºàVÔºâ = 0.630 mag), followed by extinction corrections. Further analysis revealed that the H II region exhibits high star formation activity. The star formation rate surface density, derived from the HŒ± emission line luminosity, is Œ£SFR = 0.084 M‚äô yr‚Åª¬π kpc‚Åª¬≤. Additionally, the strong emission line method indicated its high metallicity, with an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.293 dex. These findings suggest that this region is a star-forming area with significant dust extinction, active star formation, and rich mental enrichment.
