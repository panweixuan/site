Greetings! I’m Weixuan Pan, a forth-year undergraduate student majoring Astronomy at [School of Physics and Materials Science](https://spee.gzhu.edu.cn/), [Guangzhou University](https://www.gzhu.edu.cn/). Currently I am seeking PhD opportunity after my undergraduate study. Currently, I have primarily engaged in research across multiple areas of galaxy formation and evolution. I also remain open to and interested in other fields.
